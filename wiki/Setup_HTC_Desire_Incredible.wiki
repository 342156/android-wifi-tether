=Setup Howto for HTC Desire, HTC Incredible=

The *"HTC Desire"* and *"HTC Droid Incredible"* need some extra setup-steps to make "Wireless Tether for Root Users" work. 

(First you need to root your device. Please use google-search to find a guide/tutorial).


----
*1)* *Download* a *HTC Evo 4g system-dump* (use google search - I bet you will find one)

*2)* *Extract a file* named *fw_bcm4329_ap.bin* (located in /system/etc/firmware)

*3)* *Mount your sdcard*

*4)* Create a directory named "android.tether" (without quotes)

*5)* Open this directory and copy/move fw_bcm4329_ap.bin into it.

*6)* Rename *fw_bcm4329_ap.bin to fw_bcm4329.bin*

*7)* *Install* the latest versions of *"wireless tether"*

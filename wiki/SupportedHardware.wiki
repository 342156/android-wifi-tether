Wireless Tether for Root Users needs netfilter-support compiled into the kernel. This means that the Linux kernel on your device needs to have the features (CONFIG_NETFILTER and CONFIG_IP_NF_IPTABLES) enabled. If you have an ADP G1, please read [ADP15KernelUpdate], otherwise you will need to find a firmware/kernel with these features. The developers of Wireless Tether are unable to help with other types of devices (but donations of hardware/etc would help ;).
